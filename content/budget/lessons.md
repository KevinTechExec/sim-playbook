* __Boston SIM__ Have a Budget – We always talk about the budget. I know and realize what they want and expect in terms of payment at the end of the event. We have a large speaker budget of 40-50k but don’t always spend it. I don’t think we went over 25k-30k the past two years and it was one of our best events.

* __EFM__ Spending more money on the event also means more revenue will need to be generated, so we will need help selling sponsorships to IT vendor companies.

* __DFW SIM__ Also to discuss roles, revenue and cost splitting, etc.
