## Boston SIM Lessons Learned

Have the right people involved, at the highest level.  In the Boston event, CIOs are engaged in the highest positions of the event.  It is very important to have their input because they are leading teams every day that will be heavily impacted by the content.  They lead the charge.  Vendor members are also engaged in some of the committees.

## Engagement Targets

It is better to have fewer engaged CIOs than many who are disengaged. Engaged CIOs make decisions, complete surveys, answer emails and are part of the team.

Maybe a large fully engaged group of ~20 CIOs organized into sub-teams
* 4-5 CIOs each in a sub-team. Each sub-team owns identified tracks. 
* Group pictures. Advisory Board together and engaged as a team
* EFM can do a White Board session (1.5 – 2 hrs.) 15 – 20 participants. 
    * What is going on in the mkt now, 
    * SWOT existing Dallas Events… 
    * Follow up with a Supper / Cocktails,  
    * Deliver results from this session at the conference. 
    * ID 8-10 themes for breakouts, Select the best 
    * Follow up, tie out results.
•	If engaged CIOs have responsibilities it helps them stay engaged, they make decisions, bring in speakers, bring in their teams,
	
## EFM Thoughts on CIO Participation
Making sure the CIO advisors in the event are truly engaged in the planning and attend.  Throwing a picture of a CIO on the website that does not participate in any conversations or e-mails does not add value to the event. Seek committed not just limited Advisors.

Engaging more CIOs into the agenda – each breakout track should have one CIO session minimum if not 2.  Elevating content will bring more executive level attendance.  We are not after the CIOs that participate in all the other events, that just looks like a repeat that has already happed (to an attendee).

How do we engage different and new people who may not come out that often?  If you really want to elevate an event, we have to find a way to those people.
