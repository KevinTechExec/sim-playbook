* EFM knows keynote speakers, paid Keynote speakers; EFM will propose a Keynote budget (inside & outside IT).  
    *   Robert Mueller?    Perhaps…
* EFM knows Brian P. Watson – Journalist for CIO Magazine. Brian knows CIOs and writes articles about them. He has many contacts. 
    * Fireside chats may be a bit dated but a couple hi-profile CIO interviews could be done and possibly on some Breakout teams, too. 
    * He also has relationships with other markets at other locations and startup companies, too.
* Additional Keynote speakers and details: 
    * Speaker Bureau in KC, Jim Speaker Bureau in St. Louis. 
    * A good keynote is ~$10,000 each.  Less keynotes is more, sometimes.
    * Politicians, Sports Figures, Celebrities often have good keynote speeches
