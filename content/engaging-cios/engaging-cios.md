## How to Engage CIO's

* Engage CIOs not working in other events. 
    * Some CIOs are eager to speak and want to get in front of audiences, some do not. 
* We could / should target Brand Name CIOs. 
    * Find a way to get to those CIOs. 
    * Use a hybrid approach. 
    * These CIOs differentiate, lend credibility to the Event. 
    * Leverage Advisory Board members and other well connected members to bring in their peers.
